## The following are known issues
Some components cause problems with other components or "external"
elements.

### Modals and popovers
When you put popovers on a page with modals (or image modals),
the modals break.

### Modals and vector
Modals are not fully compatible with the vector skin. Therefore they are
missing the background overlay. Also, you might notice a slight "wobble"
in vector's header every time the modal pops up.

### Modals and definition lists
Some user experience broken html output when trying to use modals as the
term in definition lists. Using the html equivalent causes the same
problem.
